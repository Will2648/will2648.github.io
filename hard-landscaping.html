				<h5 class="card-title">What Is Hard Landscaping?</h5>
				<p class="card-text">Hard landscaping (also known as hardscaping) relates to the non-plant
					substance in landscape design, such as driveways, steps, walkways,
					fencing, patios and drainage schemes.
					This generally includes materials positioned by human design that improve or shield the
					immediate environment. Hard landscaping necessitates constructing
					artificial features that would otherwise be subject to deterioration and erosion due to
					intense
					use.
					For example, raised wooden walkways or stone paths make walking trails feasible where there
					would otherwise be mud. Hardscaping also permits
					the construction of vertical structures and impermeable surfaces that call for man-made
					drainage.
					For example, retaining walls can even out slopes, hold back soil and assist with drainage.
					Groundworks can often be referred to as hard landscaping.</p>

					<h5>What Materials Are Used For Hard Landscaping?</h5>
					<p>The materials utilized in hard landscaping each come with precise
						advantages,
						and if selected accurately they can considerably improve the value of your home.
						Concrete, asphalt, glass, wood, brick, stone, metal and gravel are fashionable types of
						hardscaping resources. The huge range of materials used in hard landscaping is the key to
						their dramatic visual impression. A wooden decked walkway lined with a rock-filled water
						channel on either side looks ornamental while supplying a realistic drainage solution.
						Some arrangements of materials compare well together for maximum visual and functional
						impact. Paired with artificial turf, a concrete patio and matching paving is attractive
						and easy to maintain. This combination avoids the need for mowing, watering, fertilising
						and pesticides.</p>

				<h5 class="card-title">The Different Types of Materials Used for Hard Landscaping</h5>
				<p class="card-text">Concrete is one of the most flexible and inexpensive materials for
					hardscaping
					jobs. It is perfect for
					patios, paving, steps, driveways and fence posts. Patios and other concrete features don't
					have
					to be dull
					grey since a plain concrete slab can be coloured, either by dry or liquid pigments or by
					staining a finished
					slab. Building concrete structures
					is also a popular method for preventing soil erosion around your home's foundation.
					Alternatively, stone and bricks are used
					for paving. Tiles are an attractive decorative feature for vertical and horizontal surfaces.
					Wood and bamboo are commonly
					used for fencing, seating, arbours and gazebos. Various types of metal, including
					corrosion-resistant steel and aluminium,
					are used for landscape edging of all heights.</p>

				<h5 class="card-title">How To Prune Roses</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Take your time pruning roses - with a little thought and care, you'll get the very best out of them and hopefully pave the way for some superb blooms in a few months' time.</li>
					<li>As with all pruning, the main reason is not necessarily to curb growth, though this is a
						factor. It's to
						reinvigorate, refresh and encourage the plant to produce new, and hopefully, healthy growth.
					</li>
					<li>If the weather where you are is currently frozen, snowy and exceptionally cold, then leave
						it a few weeks,
						but otherwise, get cracking now before your rose awakens and decides to start growing. </li>

					<h5 class="card-title">Tips To Attract Squirrels</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>Fill a squirrel feeder with corn, sunflower seeds, and nuts. You can use either a feeder 
							specifically made for squirrels or a bird feeder.
						</li>
						<li>Scatter corn, nuts, or seeds at the bottom of trees. If you don't have a feeder, you can still attract squirrels by 
							scattering food that they 
							enjoy at the base of trees and shrubs. Feeding squirrels in this manner may encourage squirrels to nest in your yard.
						</li>
						<li>Place corn cobs and nut balls up in trees. Stick these on high branches or near hollows where squirrels may like to nest. 
							This will bring squirrels into your trees. </li>
						<li>Put out bowls and fountains to provide water. Water is just as important as food to squirrels. Make sure that the squirrels have a
							 clean source of water somewhere in your yard. Natural sources of water are ideal, but you can also put out basins of water.</li>
